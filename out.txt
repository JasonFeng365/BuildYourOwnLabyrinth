<h3>Navigating menus</h3>
<p>The AT&T S10-S3 Universal Remote is used to navigate through the menus. Press the volume keys <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> to move the cursor up and down, and press <code>MUTE</code> to select an option.</p>

<h3>Entering username</h3>
<p>The default username is <code>PLAYER</code>. To enter a custom username, navigate to the main menu and then select <code>Change Username</code>. This will open a prompt to enter a username to be used. Usernames are used in level leaderboards, where the top three fastest times are recorded.</p>
<p>Usernames have a maximum length of <code>10</code> characters, and include lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. To enter a character, number pad <code>0</code> through <code>9</code> loop through the letters listed by the button. For example, pressing <code>2</code> once inputs <code>A</code>, pressing <code>2</code> twice inputs <code>B</code>, three for <code>C</code>, four for <code>A</code>, and so forth. <code>0</code> can be used to input a space. In this mode, volume keys enable and disable caps lock, and channel keys enable and disable number mode for entering numbers. When both caps lock and number mode are enabled, a special character corresponding to the shifted character on a keyboard is input instead: for example, <code>1</code> would go to <code>!</code>, and <code>5</code> would go to <code>%</code>.</p>
<p><code>LAST</code> is a backspace that deletes the most recently-entered character. <code>MUTE</code> saves the username and returns to the previous menu.</p>

<h3>Level select</h3>
<p>There are two types of levels: sample levels and user levels. Sample levels cannot be changed, and their leaderboards are never reset. Sample levels act as a tutorial for users to get accustomed to the controls of the game.</p>
<p>Users can create their own levels with the level editor, which can be played in the user levels. As there are only eight user levels available, user levels can be overridden by new levels. User levels' leaderboards are reset whenever a new level takes its place.</p>

<h3>Leaderboards</h3>
<p>The top three users per level can be used by navigating to the leaderboards menu, selecting sample or user levels, and selecting a level number. This displays a screen with the top three highest scores. Pressing any key returns to the previous menu.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>Each level is played on a <code>5</code> by <code>5</code> grid comprised of tiles. The player controls a marble by tilting the TI CC3200 LaunchPad, which controls the speed and direction of the marble. The goal is to roll the marble from it's starting point, the topmost tile of the grid, to the goal, the bottom tile of the grid, in the least time possible. The top three users will have their times recorded in the leaderboards for each level.</p>
<p>Falling off the map resets the marble to it's starting point, giving the player another chance to reach the goal.</p>
<p>During gamplay, pressing any key on the remote returns to the previous menu, if the user wants to exit the level early.</p>
